Some `raw` files are fetched from `../scripts/fetch.py`. 

The `phosphosite-irefindex13.0-uniprot.txt` is
a background interactome provided by SPRAS: https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/spras/blob/be8bc7f8d71880d7ce9c9ceeeddfefa6eb60c522/input/phosphosite-irefindex13.0-uniprot.txt.

The `ko03250.xml` is from `https://www.kegg.jp/entry/ko03250`. Specifically, if you click on the pathway image in the entry,
you'll get to https://www.kegg.jp/pathway/ko03250, where you download the KGML file (which is formatted as a `.xml` file)
under `Download` -> `KGML`. (The final file is at https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/download?entry=ko03250&format=kgml).
