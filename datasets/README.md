# datasets

Datasets contains both the raw data (straight from the study/database), as well as Python scripts and an associated Snakemake file
which take all of the raw data and produce SPRAS-compatible data.

Some (soon all, as to be addressed in a later PR) datasets also come with a `metadata.jsonc`,
containing extra data to be used by the SPRAS-benchmarking website.
